zero-passwords-server
=====================

Shell scripts to setup a Ubuntu server
where login and sudo only make use of an SSH key.

Note: there is probably very little specific to Ubuntu in these scripts,
but I have developed them on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and the current target
is Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. You may be able to adapt them with limit changes
for different flavors of UNIX systems.
